<h1>Containerisation and Deployment of Wisecow Application on Kubernetes </h1>

<h3>Project Repository: https://github.com/nyrahul/wisecow Wisecow App </h3>

<h2>Objective: To containerize and deploy the Wisecow application, hosted in the above-mentioned GitHub repository, on a Kubernetes environment with secure TLS communication. </h2>

<h2>Requirements:<h2> 

<h3>Dockerization: </h3> <li> Develop a Dockerfile for creating a container image of the Wisecow application. </li>

<h3> Kubernetes Deployment: </h3> <li> Craft Kubernetes manifest files for deploying the Wisecow application in a Kubernetes environment. </li> <li> The Wisecow app must be exposed as a Kubernetes service for accessibility. </li>

<h3>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): <h3> <h4>Implement a GitHub Actions workflow for:</h4> <li> Automating the build and push of the Docker image to a container registry whenever changes are committed to the repository. </li> <li>Continuous Deployment [Challenge Goal]: Automatically deploy the updated application to the Kubernetes environment following successful image builds. </li>
<h3>TLS Implementation [Challenge Goal]: </h3> <li> Ensure that the Wisecow application supports secure TLS communication. </li>

<h3>Expected Artifacts:</h3> <li> A private GitHub repository containing: </li>
<li> The Wisecow application source code. </li>
<li> The Dockerfile for the application. </li>
<li> Kubernetes manifest files for deployment</li>
<li> The CI/CD pipeline configuration. </li> 
<li>A GitHub Actions workflow file for facilitating Continuous Build and Deployment (CI/CD) </li>

<h3>The end goal of the successful containerization and deployment of the Wisecow application to the Kubernetes environment with an automated CI/CD pipeline and secured with TLS communication was achieved. </h3>
